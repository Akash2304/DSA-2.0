/**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
Example 3:

Input: n = 0
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 104

        int count = 0 ;
        for (int i = 5; n / i >= 1; i *= 5){

In a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 10 in the factorial's prime factorization. Since 10 can be written as 2 * 5,
  a trailing zero is produced whenever there is a pair of factors of 2 and 5 in the factorial.

Counting the factors of 2 is typically not a concern, as there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in the prime factorization of most integers.

The count of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of n! is what contributes to the count of trailing zeros. This is because, for every factor of 5, there will be
a corresponding factor of 2 available in the factorial to pair with it and create a factor of 10.

So, when you're counting the multiples of 5 within the range from 1 to n, you're effectively counting the numbers that contribute at least one factor of 5 to the
prime factorization of n!. These multiples of 5 ensure that there will be enough factors of 2 available to create pairs of 2 and 5, leading to trailing zeros.

For example, let's take n = 25:

There are 5 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, 25) within the range of 1 to 25.
These multiples contribute to the prime factorization of 25! in the following way:
5! = 5 * 2^2 * 2^1 * 2^1 * 2^0 (two factors of 5)
The other factors of 2 are available from other even numbers.
Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5 to the prime factorization of the factorial, ensuring that there are enough 2s to pair with these 5s and 
create trailing zeros.

I apologize for any confusion earlier. The crucial idea is that you count the multiples of 5 to determine the number of trailing zeros, as each multiple of 5 
  contributes at least one trailing zero to the factorial.

why we doing   i *= 5
ChatGPT
Apologies if that part wasn't clear in my previous explanations. The reason for the line i *= 5 in the code is to increment the value of i by a factor of 5 in each
iteration of the loop. This increment is used to consider the multiples of higher powers of 5 within the range of 1 to n.

Let's take an example to illustrate why this is necessary:

Suppose n is 30. If you only consider the multiples of 5 within the range of 1 to 30, you would count 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. This is because these are the numbers 
that are directly divisible by 5.

However, in the prime factorization of n!, you also need to consider the contribution of higher powers of 5. For example:

There's one additional factor of 5 from numbers that are multiples of 25 (5^2): 25.
There's one more factor of 5 from the number 30, which is a multiple of 5^1.
By incrementing i by a factor of 5 in each iteration, the loop accounts for these higher powers of 5. So, after one iteration, i becomes 25, and in the next iteration,
it becomes 125, and so on. This allows the loop to consider the additional factors of 5 that come from higher powers of 5 in the prime factorization of n!.

In summary, i *= 5 is a mechanism to ensure that the loop considers all the necessary multiples of higher powers of 5, which contribute to the count of trailing zeros
in the factorial.
